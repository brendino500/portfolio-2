# :rocket: Portfolio II :rocket:

## :sun_with_face: Overview

- [Visit my site](https://brendaty.com)

- This is the second attempt at my portfolio.
- I decided to code this again as **I feel my code has improved since I had finished the first version**. In my last site I used [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) but not in the best way. It was hard to make it responsive and in **hindsight looked really messy**.
- A week before starting this project I had coded an [ecommerce site](https://jungle-kobenhavn.herokuapp.com) with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) which is my **absolute favourite library.** Once I finished that app, I wanted to **redo my portfolio as I had learnt a lot about Material in that project**.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technologies and Tools

- JavaScript
- Material UI
- React
- [React-fade-in](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fade-in)
- [Whimsicle](whimsical.com)

---

## :bulb: Planning

- Unlike my last site, I actually made wireframes on Whimsicle. **This helped me a lot to focus on what I should code** rather than getting distracted with a lot animation libraries.

- Luckily I had the majority of the code from my last project so I carried over some functionality ie the burger menu and the skills cards as well as fonts and colour scheme.

## :dart: Features

- I added Material's Accordion feature for my experience. This was a new component I had not used before and I think it's effective for what I need.

- I also used the react-fade-in as it had a similar effect of a parallax without the hard work.

- Lastly, I implemented the react `useRef` for the scrolling.
